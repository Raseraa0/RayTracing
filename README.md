# 📌 Ray Tracing

![Project preview](./TODO.png)

## 📝 Overview

Project made in `C++`, the goal is to reproduce a `Ray Tracing` system, by implementing variations such as light sources, textures, different object shapes. This is my first project in C++, which helped me familiarize myself with the syntax as well as the best practices to adopt.

For this project, i followed [this tutorial](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and then I took some initiative to add some feature i thought about.
